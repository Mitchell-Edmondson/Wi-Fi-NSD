See a list of available Wi-Fi in your area in order from strongest connectivity to weakest. Incoporated Android's Network Service Discovery (NSD) so that way you can register, discover and connect to other devices that are connected on your same network.

You can register a service, calling it what you wish, onto your network. Following that you can discover services on your network, you don't need to register one beforehand though in order to test it. 

Still working on connecting to other devices.
